Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map. That means we need full address like Anfield Rd, Anfield, Liverpool L4 0TH, United Kingdom to get the coordinates -33.841291,151.2219017.
